The current version has a workable stage and button commands. The game is a 3-button fighter with light-medium-heavy.

(A) -> (B) -> (C)
  \	   \		\
Light	Medium	Heavy

Further actions of A-B-C can be from crouches or from the air.
Pressing A+B causes the character to grab within their reach.

The basic premise of the game is to deplete the opponent's healthbar to zero. Depleting the healthbar is caused by landing your own attacks onto them. Strategize your moves and assure you yourself don't lose all of your health.

Characters

Gina: A well rounded fighter in which the game design centre around. Gina's movesets focuses on keeping a midrange distance on the opponent in the start of the round and slowly inches her way into close quarters.

Otis(not-workable): An aggressive fighter whose main goal is to quickly close in and apply pressure. All his movesets have incredibly short range, but his moves are fast and confusing.
